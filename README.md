# Kaggle Challenge: Walmart stores sales forecasting
This repository presents a bunch of notebooks to tackle Kaggle Challenge i.e. Walmart Store sales forecasting. Challenge along with 
the dataset is available at:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting
Dataset consists of total 45 stores sales consisting of different products at different timestamps. As it is a time series dataset, 
different forecasting algorithms were tried as presented in the notebooks. Forecasting algorithms are:
1. Linear Regression
2. Fb Prophet
3. LSTM (keras)
4. LSTM (Pytorch)

For dimensionality reduction, auto-encoders were trained both in Keras and Pytorch.
